**bitwise operand questions**

1. Use of bitwise XOR

2. NOT

3. AND

4. OR

5. Left Shift

6. Right Shift


**Facts :**

/**
 * The left-shift and right-shift operators are equivalent to multiplication and division by 2 respectively.
 * Eg. 12 << 3 ======> 12*(2^3) = 96
 * Eg 16 >> 4 =======> 16 /(2^4) = 1
 * The left shift and right shift operators cannot be used with negative numbers.
 * one left shift is just double of number eg: 2 << 1 ======> 4
 * one right shift is just half of number eg: 2 >> 1 ======> 1
 * 
 * The & operator can be used to quickly check if a number is odd or even. The value of expression (x & 1) would be non-zero only if x is odd, otherwise the value would be zero.
